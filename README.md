## About
The idea is to implement a game similar to the very popular doodle jump. The main goal is a game where the player climbs by jumping on platforms and collects points based on how high they've climbed. Add-ons such as monsters will be implemented if we have the time needed. This will be done with the use of the java game development framework [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/).
